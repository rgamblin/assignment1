		My name is Rodger Lawrence Gamblin. I give my middle name prominence because I am the third Rodger Gamblin in a line.
	I was born in Centerville, Ohio which is a suburb of Dayton. I’m 32, but my father has been a computer technician my entire life, 
	so even though I was born in 1982, I always had the latest computer equipment to mess around with since I was 4. Since then 
	computers and electronic equipment have always been a part of my life in some way or another, including my five and a half
	years as a US Navy Electronics Technician. I currently live in Eugene, Oregon and possess a BA in Linguistics from the 
	University of Oregon. I decided to attend OSU because I wanted to study something interesting and lucrative, and as someone 
	who has lived in Oregon as long as I have I have great respect for the OSU’s technical programs. I have limited resources 
	so the ability to take my classes and stay in town is very attractive to me. Additionally, I generally don’t prefer to leave 
	home, so this is an ideal setup for me. My interests and hobbies paint me as a lifelong member of the “nerd” demographic. 
	I love comic books, particularly about superheroes, from a grand variety of different authors and time periods. I love 
	television with all of my heart, and have watched just a criminal amount of it. My other favorite art form is games, including 
	but not exclusive to video games, which I have had the privilege of seeing evolve throughout my life. I have played a whole 
	lot of D&D. I have a great breadth of knowledge of these subjects, and when I was 15 this gave me an absurd sense of elitist 
	pride. Nowadays I’m the first to make fun of how nerdy I am, though I’m also the first to defend any of the previous mentioned 
	media as “art forms” comparable to painting or sculpture. Only with more Spider-Man. My major is, not surprisingly, Computer Science. 
	I am here to get that degree and learn to code, so that I may become a software developer. At this time I am leaning strongly 
	toward game development. Not only does it fit my knowledge base and skill set, but I have a friend who has been a coder and 
	game designer for over 15 years who works for the local developer Pipeworks as well as his own startup. He has been making 
	strong overtures to get me into the business for years now and Pipeworks has in the past hired OSU grads as developers. 
	It seems like “the dream” to work in the nerdy arts for the rest of my life and to have such a wide open door as this, 
	but I still find myself torn. It’s because I believe in science, engineering, and the advancement of the human race. 
	Making games would be excellent and useful to the world and give me a chance to help this world by addressing it through 
	it’s collective consciousness, but I worry that it’s a saturated profession, that maybe we have all the games we need. I’ll
	probably go for it anyway.
